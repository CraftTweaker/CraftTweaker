/**
 * Represents a predicate for a {@link net.minecraft.util.DamageSource}.
 *
 * The predicate can be used to match against a various set of types that identify the damage source type and
 * characteristics, such as being caused by magic or bypassing invulnerability. Moreover, the predicate can also check
 * for specific properties of the entity that caused the damage or the direct entity (refer to {@link TargetedEntity}
 * for the semantic difference), via {@link EntityPredicate}s.
 *
 * By default, any damage source will pass this predicate's checks.
