/**
 * Builder for the 'RandomChanceWithLooting' loot condition.
 *
 * This condition can be used to draw a random number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive). This number will then
 * be checked against the specified chance multiplied by the looting modifier provided by the
 * {@link net.minecraft.loot.LootContext}. The condition will then pass only if the drawn number is less than the
 * computed one. Effectively, this allows the creation of a condition that will only run a certain percentage of times,
 * as specified by the chance value, with this percentage steadily increasing the higher the looting modifier is.
 *
 * A 'RandomChanceWithLooting' condition is well-formed if the chance is between 0.0 and 1.0 (both exclusive) and the
 * looting modifier is different from 0.0. If that's not the case, then the 'RandomChanceWithLooting' will either always
 * fail, if the chance is less than or equal to 0.0, always pass, if the chance is higher than or equal to 1.0, or be
 * equivalent to a 'RandomChance' loot condition, if the looting modifier is 0.0.
