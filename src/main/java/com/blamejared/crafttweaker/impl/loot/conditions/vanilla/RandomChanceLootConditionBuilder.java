/**
 * Builder for the 'RandomChance' loot condition.
 *
 * This condition can be used to draw a random number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive). This number will then
 * be checked against the specified chance and the condition will pass only if the drawn number is less than the given
 * one. Effectively, this allows the creation of a condition that will only run a certain percentage of times, as
 * specified by the chance value.
 *
 * A 'RandomChance' condition is well-formed if the given value is between 0.0 and 1.0 (both exclusive). If that's not
 * the case, then the 'RandomChance' will either always fail, if the value is less than or equal to 0.0, or always pass,
 * if the value is higher than or equal to 1.0.
