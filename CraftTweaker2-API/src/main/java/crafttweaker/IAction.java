 * There also exist semi-permanent actions. Those actions can return an override
 * key; if a newer action has the same override key as an old action, the new
 * action is considered to override the old one.
 * <p>
 * Likewise, actions can implement hashCode and equals methods to indicate that
 * they are equal. If an action is equal to a non-undoable stuck action, it will
 * be omitted from execution.
