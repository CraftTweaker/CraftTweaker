/*
    A Sequence is a set of tasks that can be composed and ran.

    With a Sequence, you can run a task, wait a set amount of ticks, and then run another task,
    without having to worry about the boilerplate that would usually come with doing that.

    Sequences are *currently* not persisted, this means that if a server stops while a sequence is running,
    then it will **not** be restarted, so while you can make a sequence wait 5 in-game days before another task,
    if the server restarts while it is waiting for those days, it will not be resumed at that step.

    You can achieve some persistence with tasks by making use of SavedData, an example of that will be below.

    This file will have examples for Cauldron interactions, SavedData and obviously Sequences
